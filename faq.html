            <div class="question">
                Why did you start TechDiversified?
                <div class="answer">
                    In 2014, some of the world's leading technology companies <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.twitter.com/2014/building-a-twitter-we-can-be-proud-of">released their diversity metrics</a>, confirming what many already knew -
                    <br>
                    <strong>
                        people of color and women are largely excluded from high-paying tech jobs.
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    It is time to level the playing field.
                    <br>
                    We want to help develop and funnel talented people of color into high-paying tech jobs.  This will help companies find qualified individuals for their unfilled positions as well as provide higher income salaries for populations that <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_wage_gap_in_the_United_States">typically earn less than average.</a>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                Is Tech Diversified open to everyone?
                <div class="answer">
                    Yes. Inclusivity is very important to us.  Although our target audience is <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color">people of color</a>, our primary goal is to have a positive learning environment that welcomes everyone regardless of race, age, religion, sexual orientation, disability or education - we want to work with everyone.

                Do I need any experience to participate in the technical workshops?
                <div class="answer">

            <div class="question">
                Where are workshops & meetups held?

                    <br>
                    Many workshops will happen in the Ballard office, although some workshops may take place in local coffee shops or other meeting areas, depending on convenience and availability.

                Are you a 501 (c) (3)?
                <div class="answer">
                    We have submitted our application for 501 (c ) (3) status in 2014.  We will update our status as soon as our status has been accepted.

            <div class="question">
                What if I don't have my own computer?
                <div class="answer">
                    While we would love to supply everyone with a computer – we have not reached that point yet.
                    Members are expected to bring their own machines, though we may be able to supply a limited number of loaners if necessary.
