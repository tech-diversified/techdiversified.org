                Our series of free technical workshops are taught by experienced industry professionals with the goal of familiarizing members with modern programming concepts.  We do not currently have the capacity to fully teach people how to code; rather, we want to give members enough information to decide whether or not to pursue a particular language or framework further.

            <div class="galileoMedium" id="workshopExamples">

                Perhaps more important to newcomers are non-technical aspects of the technology industry.  Some of the most common requests we get are to describe what to expect in an interview or discuss what it is like to work with a team of developers, or even tips on writing a resume. Our series of non-technical workshops will explain business and communication concepts that can be sometimes overlooked, yet could be the deciding factor between you and another qualified job candidate.

                    Tech Diversified’s network includes a professional career counselor, who will be able to help you form a strategy for achieving your goals. In today's competitive job market,  having a professional assess your skill sets, review your resume, and give overall advice is a tremendous advantage.

                    Tech Diversified will periodically have an open lab at their space in Ballard staffed by volunteers with knowledge of a variety of programming languages and skills.  We encourage you to stop by with your pet project and ask for help (or just show us what you’re up to!).  Think of it as a place to hang out and ask questions, or just talk shop.

                    The Tech Diversified <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Tech-Diversified" target="_blank">Meetup</a> group meets monthly at our workshop space in Ballard. 
                    This Meetup attracts people with a range of interests and experience levels - from those just starting out to people with 20 years of development experience. 
                    We also see educators, marketing and advertising professionals, entrepreneurs and college students.  It’s a great place to come meet other people with similar interests and an excellent opportunity to network with industry professionals.
